- Sensing
- Decision Making

## 寻路系统

三要素：
- Map representation
- Path finding
- Path smoothing

### Map representation

- We need to tell AI agents where they can walk - Walkable Area
- Walkable Area of players is determined by character motion capabilities
    - Physical Collision
    - Climbing slope/height
    - Jumping distance
- Simulating movement of AI agents as players costs too much
- AI agents are still expected to have the same walkable area as players


Formats:
- Waypoint Network
- Grid
- Nav Mesh
- Sparse Voxel Octree

## NavMesh Generation

Region Segmentation:
- Calculate the distance of each voxel to border
- Mark border voxels by AgentRadius to avoid clipping
- Watershed AlgorithmP: Gradually flood the terrain
- Segment the "neighboring" voxels into regions to provide a good basis for polygon mesh

- Mesh Generation from segmented regions
